          <section id="about-chavez" class="biography">
          <p class="biography-text indent">Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. <br /><br />
            
 In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Only one of his paintings was known by name to have been sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his suicide at age 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness.</p>

            <h2 class="biography-header">Early Life<h2>
            <p class="biography-text indent">Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in the small village of Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. He was the eldest son of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Vincent had four siblings, two brothers, and two sisters.<br /><br />

Growing up in a religious and cultured family, Vincent was exposed to art and literature from a young age. He attended various schools throughout his childhood, demonstrating a keen interest in drawing and sketching from an early age. However, his formal education was sporadic, and he left school at the age of 16.<br /><br />

In his early adulthood, Vincent worked in various roles, including as an art dealer's assistant in The Hague and London. Despite his artistic inclinations, he initially struggled to find his calling and often felt directionless. It wasn't until his late twenties that he decided to pursue a career as an artist.<br /><br />

            <h2 class="biography-header">Career</h2>
            <p class="biography-text indent">Vincent van Gogh's decision to pursue a career as an artist came relatively late in life. In his early twenties, he worked in various roles, including as a teacher and a preacher's assistant, before eventually finding his calling in art. Despite his late start, van Gogh's passion and dedication to his craft would propel him to great heights in the art world.<br /><br /> 
          
Van Gogh's early works were heavily influenced by the Dutch Masters and reflected a dark and somber aesthetic. However, his style underwent a radical transformation after he moved to Paris in 1886. Exposed to the works of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, van Gogh began experimenting with bold colors, expressive brushwork, and innovative compositions.<br /><br />

One of the most significant periods in van Gogh's career occurred during his time in Arles, a town in the south of France, where he experienced a burst of creative energy and produced some of his most iconic works. Inspired by the vibrant colors and landscapes of Provence, van Gogh painted a series of masterpieces, including "The Starry Night" and "Sunflowers."<br /><br />

Throughout his career, van Gogh's mental health remained precarious, and he experienced frequent episodes of depression and anxiety. These struggles often manifested in his art, with themes of loneliness, isolation, and inner turmoil prevalent in many of his works.</p>
